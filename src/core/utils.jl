    NOTE: levelization_factor for an electricity producing tech is the ratio of:
    - an annuity with an escalation rate equal to the electricity cost escalation rate, starting year 1,
        and a negative escalation rate (the tech's degradation rate), starting year 2
    - divided by an annuity with an escalation rate equal to the electricity cost escalation rate (pwf_e).
    Both use the offtaker's discount rate.
    levelization_factor is multiplied by each use of dvRatedProduction in reopt.jl 
        (except dvRatedProduction[t,ts] == dvSize[t] âˆ€ ts).
    This way the denominator is cancelled in reopt.jl when accounting for the value of energy produced
    since each value constraint uses pwf_e.
